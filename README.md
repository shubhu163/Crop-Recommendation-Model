# Crop-Recommendation-Model
It is a Machine Learning Model performed in Jupyter Notebook used to predict crops on the given factors such as weather, NPK values and rainfall. Different algorithms were compared and the best one was used. Testing results showed that Random Forest performed better than other models, with an accuracy of 95%.

Algorithms-
1. Decision Tree
2. Naive Bayes Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. SVM Classifier
